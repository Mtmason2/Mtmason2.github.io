   <b>Week 1</b><br>
    Welcome to my portfolio. As you can see it is lacking in any particular substance and is rather rudimentary.<br>
    Well that is going to change!...Hopefully!<br>
    What is currently nothing will in the next six weeks turn into a webpage about music and in particular, guitars.<br>
    So tune in next week for an updated site!<br>
    <b>Week 2</b><br>
    For this week's update I will be talking about myself and how I became passionate about music. <br>
    My love for playing music comes from an early indoctrination into the music world. My mother is a signer songwriter,<br>
    my uncle is a studio guitarist, my grandmother sang jazz tunes while my grandfather backed her up with piano.<br>
    From a young age I would watch my family perform together and I knew that I wanted to perform like them. <br>
    <br>
    At 10 years old I had saved up enough money from mowing lawns to purchase my first guitar.<br>
    It was an all black Epiphone Les Paul Special II.

      alt="Epiphone Les Paul">
    This guitar started my passion for not just playing guitar but building them as well.<br>
    After many years of playing and tinkering with guitars I finally decided to fully build one on my own.

      alt="Custom Built Bass">
    This is the first instrument I ever built, and it was built for a band I had been playing with for a few years.<br>
    It is a PJ Fender style bass with a rosewood neck, Duncan PJ set with a blender knob configuration.<br>
    I could write pages on the building process of this bass, but I will leave some links that helped me with my first build<br>
    <br>
    For first time builders I would recommend building from a set of parts instead of fabricating them yourself.<br>
    My favorite site for parts would have to be <a href="https://warmoth.com/">Warmoth Custom Guitar and Bass Parts</a><br>
    Another great resource for building is <a href="https://www.stewmac.com/video-and-ideas/online-resources/learn-about-guitar-pickups-and-electronics-and-wiring/understanding-guitar-wiring-part-11-sample-diagrams/"> Stewmac's Wiring diagrams.</a><br>
    Finally, the resource I used the most during my first build was <a href="http://www.youtube.com/">YouTube.</a> <br>
    Any question I had during my build was usually answered by a YouTube video.
