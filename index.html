    Welcome to Last Shot Guitars! Here you can find guitar projects, tutorials, and other content related to 
    luthier work. This site is a work in progress, but my hope is that you can still find some enjoyment or 
    information that is valuable in your guitar building or playing. Most of my knowledge on building and 
    playing guitar came from first hand teaching or self experimentation. I now want to share that information
    with others who do not have the oppurtunity to learn first hand. I am by no means an expert in the feild, 
    just a musician who has played and built guitars for over 15 years. If you find any of the content on this 
    page helpful, or have any questions, feel free to email me and let me know! <br> -Michael
