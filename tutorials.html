    How To Tune Your Guitar
  </h3>
  <p>
    One of the most basic but essential parts of playing an instrument is ensuring it is in tune.
    There are many variations of tunings as well as many ways to tune your instrument. A very different tools you can use
    to assist in tuning your instrument would be an app on your phone, a tuning pedal, relative tuning from a starting note,
    as well as a headstock tuner that clips to your instrument.

  <p>
    Standard tuning for a guitar is E A D G B E from deepest string to highest string. For bass it is E A D G. Using a tuner, 
    pluck the lowest string and adjust the tuning key until the the tuner reads the correct letter and is in the green. To 
    raise the pitch of the string, turn the tuning key counter clockwise and to lower the pitch move the tuning key clockwise. 
    You will repeat this process for each string until all strings are at the correct pitch. I recommend repeating this process 
    a few times to ensure the strings are staying in tune. I also recommend slow adjustments of the key as adjusting to quickly 
    can cause unnessecary strain on the string which can lead to a string breaking. To assist in tuning there is a video below 
    that you can follow along with.<br>
